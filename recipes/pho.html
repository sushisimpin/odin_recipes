    <h4>
      Pho is a Vietnamese soup that’s made with all the good stuff: broth,
      noodles, beef (or other protein) and lots of mix-and-match toppings. The
      best thing about pho is that it’s such a restorative food—the comforting
      soup is savory and rich, while still feeling clean and refreshing at the
      same time. But don’t just save it for cold days: Pho can be enjoyed
      year-round—and any time of day. In Vietnam, pho is a popular breakfast,
      and for good reason: It's super satisfying!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Beef bones</li>
      <li>Rice Noodles</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Herbs</li>
      <li>Rock sugar</li>
      <li>love</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Blanch the bones. This step is SO IMPORTANT. If you want a clear,
        beautiful pho broth, blanch your bones. Do this by dividing the bones
        between two large pots or stockpots. Cover with cold water. Bring to a
        boil over high heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Drain and rinse the
        bones with water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the bones and the vegetables (optional). Preheat the oven to 450
        degrees F. Transfer the bones, onion, garlic, and ginger to the roasting
        pans or rimmed baking sheets (you'll probably need two). Don’t pile them
        all on top of each other. Roast for 30 minutes before gently tossing the
        bones, and roasting for an additional 15-30 minutes more (for a total of
        45-60 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast the spices. As the bones are roasting, add all of your spices (the
        star anise, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom pods, coriander seeds, and fennel
        seeds) to a large, dry skillet over low heat. Toast the spices, stirring
        often to prevent burning, until fragrant, approximately 5 minutes.
        Divide the spices in half. Cut cheesecloth into two small square pieces
        (approximately 5-inches by 5-inches) each. Transfer the divided spices
        to the center of each square. Gather at the top and secure with kitchen
        twine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the roasted bones and veggies back to the stockpots. Making
        sure to wash the pots after the bones were blanched and drained.
        Transfer and divide the roasted bones, onion, garlic, and ginger back to
        the stockpots. Scrape up any remaining bits and juices left in the
        roasting pan using a metal spatula and a little water, if needed. Add to
        the pot with the bones (don’t worry, all those brown bits are FLAVOR!).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil. With the bones, spice sachets (one per pot), onion,
        garlic, and ginger divided between the two pots, fill each pot with
        approximately 12 cups water (or until bones are fully submerged), 1/3
        cup fish sauce and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the bones. Immediately reduce heat to low and simmer, with the
        lid slightly ajar, skimming any foam or excess fat, occasionally (if you
        blanched your bones, you shouldn’t see much foam). Simmer for at least
        6-12 hours, ideally 24 hours (do not leave the stove running overnight.
        Simply cool and store in the refrigerator and continue to simmer the
        next day). Add more water if needed to make sure the bones stay
        submerged.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the broth. Once the bones have simmered and your hot broth is
        ready, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer or colander into a clean
        pot. This separates the pretty, clear broth from the bones and spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season to taste. Add additional salt (you'll probably need a little),
        soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar or rock sugar (found at Asian markets), to
        taste. Set aside the broth to cool (if you're not using right away) and
        reserve the bones.
