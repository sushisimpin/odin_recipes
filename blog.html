      This is one of my all time favorite taco spots in Tijuana. <br> <br>Open 24/7,
      probably the only place to be open in this manner. You can find a beer or
      a stripper in Tijuana at any hours, but tacos have a closing time. Not here. You won't have to settle for McDonalds or 7/11 taquitos to hold you over til everything opens back up at 8AM. <br> <br>
      Having driven by this place multiple times, I was initally iffy about
      going to a spot located in a strip mall, as the best tacos I've found are
      usually hole in the walls or stand alone carts. However hunger hit at 5AM,
      and as Las Ahumaderas closes at 4AM on weekdays, I decided to give it a
      shot. <br />
      <br />Upon parking, I was pleasantly suprised to find that they were
      actually grilling meat over firewood outside which was eerie given the hour. The meat is then transferred into pans
      and chopped up inside. Great sign, as most places use charcoal around
      here. Firewood gives meat that extra OOOOMPH. Total kick in the ass with a one way express ticket to
      flavortown. If you show up to a taqueria and they are cooking meat over a
      flap top, quickly walk away and spend your money elsewhere. In TJ there is
      no place for anything besides grilled meats. If you are in California, well, that is what you have to live with. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I was sure I was in the right place at this point. After chatting with the
      server for a bit, I found out they are most famous for their namesake
      "perrones" taco, which loosely translates to "awesome taco", or "kickass
      taco"; something along those lines. Apparently a long time customer at the original location (this is an outpost) asked for a taco with EVERYTHING in it, and started raining down expletives while chomping down in drunken ecstasy. We've all been there. They chose to go with one of his less offensive, yet colorful descriptory words, "perrones", which I believe was a wise choice.  <br> <br> This is not the first time alcohol has lead to culinary innovation and many a line cook can attest to this. Ask me to make you my Tex-Mex hollandaise burgerdog if we are drunk enough, and prepare for the pinnacle of inebriated dining. Tecate poundings and second helpings to follow.

      Rather than a simple taco, it really is a large flour quesadilla, oozing
      with cheese, giving it that soft and supple bite that only flour tortillas
      have, stuffed with arrachera (grilled skirt steak),
      cilantro, onions, salsa, guacamole, and interestingly, beans and tiny bits
      of crispy bacon. <br> <br> And it damn well hits the spot if you are in the mood for a meatgasm. This is the kind of taco you get when you just want pure excess. 
      The beans are also an interesting addition and really flesh out the
      "perrones" taco. The official outpost is in Rosarito, where apparently an
      even better version is served. I'll report back once I try.

      Regular corn tortilla tacos are also on offer here, and they usually have a deal for 3 corn tortillas with a drink. However the perrones reigns king here and should be the only reason you came. <br />
      <br /> <br>
      I recommend coming around noon, as that is when they are grilling a fresh batch of meat to meet
      the lunch crowd demand. Their habanero salsa is to die for, if you can handle the heat. I like to mix it with some of their salsa verde for extra yum factor. Ask for
      extra if you are ordering togo as they can be skimpy with salsas. If you are extra hungry, go for the super perrones, which is basically the perrones but doubled in size and enough to feed two. Wash it all down with their caldo de res (basically a beef consomme) and that is a meal worth having with no compromise any hour of the day.
