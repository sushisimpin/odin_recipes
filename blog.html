    <p id="sexyText"> After spending the better part of a year making sushi 6-7 days a week, 12-16 hours a day, I've been on a sabbatical in Mexico as of late. It's been a well needed break and I can feel myself missing the craft, but I don't miss it quite that much; at least yet. Rotting fish guts spilt through a ripped bag over your head tends to color any romance you had for the trade. The smell sticks to your hair and skin for weeks, and soaks into the concrete for months. Chazz Palminteri may say that the saddest thing in life is wasted talent, but I proffer that the loss of a passion is a much more painful, drawn out misfortune. <br> <br> Bourdain rest his soul; we are not all destined to have food travel shows or write cookbooks; the majority of us toiling in obscurity wondering why we make wages comparable to a fast food chain worker despite years of experience and a dedication to the trade. Ask a FOH worker how much they make in a shift, and be prepared to flatten your 100 some chicken picattas with a bit of extra added indignation. Some of us got lost on the way to college. These convictions are soon buried in the buzz of shift beers and camaraderie, elated war stories of another service executed with pananche, and some shit talk thrown in jest the way of the FNG (Fucking New Guy). Maybe not so tenderly if he's been screwing up on his station consistenly. You buy him a beer anyways. Years pass like this.
      
      <br> <br> I've been spending my days in a quieter part of Tijuana, ruminating over the writings of Jim Harrison, my purpose in life, getting drunk off cheap tequila, journaling (the roosters here have made me a morning person), boxing at the many gyms on offer here, more cheap tequila, and in between moments of substantial happiness and sad mopery, I find the time to indulge in the exploration of the great cuisine this country has to offer. Cooking professionally has made me morose, but the excitement of eating magnificent food abolishes any trace of those thoughts; and in between bites of flour quesadillas filled with unctuous cheese, huitlacoche and fresh corn, I can remember why I started cooking in the first place. Which is to make me forget that I'm not really all that great at anything else.  <br> <br>
    
      This is one of my all time favorite taco spots in Tijuana. <br> <br>Open 24/7,
      probably the only taqueria to be open in this manner. You can find with relative ease the hedonistic pursuits of alcohol or
      strippers in Tijuana at any time of the day and night, the quality of both degrading by the hour, but tacos, unfortunately, have a closing time. Money is of the essence in this fast moving town, alcohol and strippers being much more lucrative businesses for the folks involved. <br> <br>

      Having driven by this place multiple times as I live a few blocks away, I was initally tentative about
      eating at a spot located in a strip mall, as the best tacos I've found are
      usually hole in the walls or stand alone carts. <br> <br> Contradictorily, Taconazo and its many locations makes arguably the best adobada in the city, with the cleanliness and looks of a Mexican In-n-Out, but they are outliers. Both beautiful and substantial; usually you have to pick one or the other. Life has a way of balancing itself. Not there. Ignore the Vegas-like decor and enjoy adobada done perfectly, with constant turnover to keep the meat fresh, crisp at the edges, the insides juicy. And hold the guacamole. Pineapple or not I do not judge, I will leave that tiresome, old discourse up to you. Fruit just might belong pizza, and possibly on a taco too. I personally prefer one of each. For about 30 pesos (about $1.50) you can have your cake and eat it too. 
      
      
      
      <br> <br> Anyways, back to Tacos Los Perrones and my taco dilemma. Hunger hit at 5AM,
      and as Las Ahumaderas closes at 4AM on weekdays, I was ready and desperate. By the way, Ahumaderas is not open 24/7 as many say as some form of interesting "in the know" tidbit. Perhaps in the past, but they are open til 6AM on the weekends, and open back up everyday at 8AM. I decided to give Perrones a
      try, lest make a half hearted attempt at an omelette at home in my tired state. <br /><br />
      
     
      
      Upon parking, I was pleasantly suprised to find that they were
      actually grilling meat over firewood outside on a two tiered contraption, which was eerie given the hour. Great sign, as most places use charcoal around here (still a perfect medium). As I sat down on the hood of my car to watch, the cook gives me a perfunctory nod, and then began to single handedly grill 10s of lbs of meat in batches by the light of dawn, taking his eyes off the large grill only momentarily to light batches of waiting firewood. 
      He worked quickly, careful to control any flareups, flipping the meats to the cool zones and back, then transferring the grilled goods into hotel pans, to be chopped up inside and foiled over by another worker. His focus and attention to detail would make any line cook (former or otherwise) proud. Usually I'd be having a beer watching such theatrics, but at 5 in the morning I opted for something less degenerate from the pharmacy next door. The smell of coffee and grilled meat turns out to be a wonderful combination, and reminds me of red-eye gravy for some reason. I decide to drink half to make some later that day; I needed some sleep anyways. <br> <br>
     
     
      If a steakhouse is cooking your meat in a pan... well you're having a fried steak my friend, no matter how much compound butter they baste on it. If the cook knows what he or she is doing, sure, there will be a carmelized crust, but no carbonized, charred parts that make up the essense of meat eating. Firewood imbues meat with a complexity and char nothing else can. It is the way meat is meant to be eaten; cooked until burnt in all the right places with crispy, charcoal-like bits that crunch with a pleasant, sweet bitterness under your teeth. Gas grills will work in a pinch; charcoal the better choice, but meat is not meant to be heated over thin sheet metal. <br> <br> I presume cavemen would have gone vegan if this were the case and would have never developed the brains necessary to evolve into homo sapiens. Some of us may be vegans now, but meat got us here. The human brain is comprised of 60% fat, and I'm sure that didn't come from spinach, kale and foraged foods. If you show up to a taqueria and they are cooking meat over a
      flap top, politely say you just ate and just wanted to see a famous spot, then spend your money elsewhere. Unless if they are using a comal, then perhaps some tlayudas are in order. More on that another time. In TJ there is
      no place for anything besides grilled meats. Anything less is settling. If you are in California, well, that is what you have to live with. But here this is a standard. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I was sure I was in the right place at this point now. After chatting with the
      server for a bit, bleary eyed due to the hour, I learned that they are most famous for their namesake
      "perrones" taco, which loosely translates to "amazing taco", or "kickass
      taco"; something along the lines of denoting awesomeness in an exclaimitory fashion. Apparently a long time customer at the original location (this is an outpost, the original is Tacos El Yaqui Perrones in Rosarito) asked for a taco with EVERYTHING in it, and started raining down expletives while munching down in a drunken stupor. We've all been there. These are the best of times. They chose to go with one of his less offensive, yet colorful descriptory words, "perrones", which was a wise choice. <br> <br> This is not the first time alcohol has lead to culinary innovation and many a line cook can attest to this. A large majority of breakthroughs in food were made when the mind is made pliable, through illicit substances (or alcohol) to try new combinations of techniques and ingredients. Poutine being one of them, with the inclusion of foie gras if you happen to be at one of the gout inducing, low-key luxurious centers of French gastronomy in Montreal. God bless Joe Beef. Or desperation and starvation; look up the history of foccaccia di Recco and you'll realize that beautiful things can come from dark places. Ask me to make you my Tex-Mex hollandaise burgerdog if we are drunk enough, and prepare for the pinnacle of inebriated dining. Tecate poundings and second helpings to follow.

        <br>  There is a time and a place to contemplate the intricacies of tripas tacos elegantly tempered with diversifed salsas, varying from spot to spot depending on that particular taqueria's preperation process and chosen cut of tripas. <br> <br> This is not one of those times. This is the kind of taco (quesadilla?) you get when you just want pure, unadulterated excess and deliciousness. <br> <br>
       Rather than a simple taco, the perrones really is a large flour quesadilla, giving it that soft and supple bite that only flour tortillas
      can give, oozing
      with cheese, stuffed with arrachera (grilled skirt steak, cut into chunks, a noble choice),
      cilantro, onions, salsa, guacamole, pinto beans, and interestingly, tiny bits
      of crispy bacon. The beans are a great addition and really flesh out the
      perrones taco with a bit of extra "meatiness" on the vegetable front, a creamy contrast to the charred meat; this all then amplified by the bacon.

    <p id="sexyText">
      Regular corn tortilla tacos are also on offer here, and they usually have a deal for 3 corn tortilla tacos with a drink. However the perrones reigns king here and should be the only reason you came. <br />
      <br /> <br>
      <em><------- The namesake perrones taco. Take note of the beans. Delicous. </em>
      <br> <br>
      I recommend coming around noon, as that is when they are grilling a fresh batch of meat to meet
      the lunch crowd demand. One thing I've noticed is that chicken is not a taco meat offering here in Mexico. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment and hope the milquetoasts may find their chicken tacos at their local Baja Fresh/Chipotle and leave the real taco eating to us. The serving of "Mexican food" with Tabasco sauce is an abomination and a trend I hope dies soon. Chipotle stock says otherwise. Hopefully one day the chicken taco will also die, but as long as we live in a world where McNuggets are a popular commidity we will also have to live with that evil. <br> <br> The habanero salsa here is one of the best I've had yet; if you can handle the heat. I personally like to unfold the perrones, douse salsa roja and verde on opposite sides, fold it back up, and and pour on a little habanero salsa as needed in between bites of the cucumber and radishes served on the side. To douse it completely in their habanero is a bit much, as you will overwhelm the perrones with painful heat. However as it is, eat it as you like. Perhaps I'm the pussy here. <br> <br> Ask for
      more salsa if you are ordering togo as they can be skimpy with the goods. If you are extra hungry, go for the super perrones, which is basically the perrones but doubled in size and enough to feed you and you again later that night. Wash it all down with a cup of their caldo de res (basically a beef consomme) and this is a meal worth having with no compromise at any hour of the day.
