    <p id="sexyText"> After spending the better part of a year making sushi 6-7 days a week, 12-16 hours a day, I've been on a sabbatical in Mexico as of late. It's been a well needed break and I can feel myself missing the craft, but I dont miss it quite that much yet. Rotting fish guts split through a ripped bag over your head tends to color any romance you had for the trade. Bourdain be damned but we are not all destined to have food travel shows; the majority of us toil in obscurity wondering why we make wages comparable to a fast food chain worker.  <br> <br> I've been spending my hours ruminating over the writings of Jim Harrison, my purpose in life, boxing at the many gyms on offer here, and in between moments of substantial happiness and sad mopery, I find the time to indulge in the exploration of the great cuisine this country has to offer. Making food as a career has made me morose, but the excitement of eating makes me forget all that and I remember why I started cooking in the first place. Which is to make me forget that I'm not really good at anything else.  <br> <br>
      This is one of my all time favorite taco spots in Tijuana. <br> <br>Open 24/7,
      probably the only taqueria to be open in this manner. You can find with relative ease the hedonistic pursuits of alcohol or
      strippers in Tijuana at any hour of the day and night, but tacos, unfortunately, have a closing time. Money is of the essence and those two are much more lucrative businesses for the folks involved. <br> <br> Not here, as neither strippers or alcohol is served. You won't have to settle for McDonalds or 7/11 taquitos to hold you over til everything opens back up at 8AM (there is a birria spot open 24/7, but I do not consider those tacos). <br> <br>
      Having driven by this place multiple times, I was initally iffy about
      going to a spot located in a strip mall, as the best tacos I've found are
      usually hole in the walls or stand alone carts. However hunger hit at 5AM,
      and as Las Ahumaderas closes at 4AM on weekdays, I decided to give it a
      shot, lest make a half hearted attempt at an omelette at home. <br />
      <br />Upon parking, I was pleasantly suprised to find that they were
      actually grilling meat over firewood outside, which was eerie given the hour. Usually BBQs are winding down at ths time, but here this guy was single handedly grilling 10s of lbs of meat in batches at dawn. He then transferred the grilled goods into pans, to be chopped up inside and foiled over by another worker. Great sign, as most places use charcoal around
      here (still a great medium). <br> <br>
      Firewood gives meat that extra OOOOMPH. It is the way meat is meant to be eaten; cooked until charred in all the right places with crispy bits. Gas grills are a cop out, and meat is not meant to be heated over thin sheet metal either. I presume cavemen would have gone vegan if this were the case. If you show up to a taqueria and they are cooking meat over a
      flap top, politely walk away and spend your money elsewhere, unless if they are making cheesesteaks. In TJ there is
      no place for anything besides grilled meats. If you are in California, well, that is what you have to live with. But here this is a standard. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I was sure I was in the right place at this point now. After chatting with the
      server for a bit, bleary eyed due to the hour, I found that they are most famous for their namesake
      "perrones" taco, which loosely translates to "amazing taco", or "kickass
      taco"; something along the lines of denoting awesomeness in an exclaimitory fashion. Apparently a long time customer at the original location (this is an outpost) asked for a taco with EVERYTHING in it, and started raining down expletives while chomping down in a drunken stupor. We've all been there. They chose to go with one of his less offensive, yet colorful descriptory words, "perrones", which I believe was a wise choice.  <br> <br> This is not the first time alcohol has lead to culinary innovation and many a line cook can attest to this. I assume a majority of breakthroughs in food were made when the mind is made pliable enough through substances to try a new combination of techniques and ingredients. Ask me to make you my Tex-Mex hollandaise burgerdog if we are drunk enough, and prepare for the pinnacle of inebriated dining. Tecate poundings and second helpings to follow.

      Rather than a simple taco, the perrones really is a large flour quesadilla, giving it that soft and supple bite that only flour tortillas
      have, oozing
      with cheese, stuffed with arrachera (grilled skirt steak),
      cilantro, onions, salsa, guacamole, pinto beans, and interestingly, tiny bits
      of crispy bacon. The beans are a great addition and really flesh out the
      perrones taco with a bit of extra "meatiness" on the vegetable front, which add a creamy contrast to the charred meat. <br> <br>  There is a time and a place to contemplate the intricacies of tripas tacos delicately tempered with salsa, varying from spot to spot depending on their particular taqueria's preperation process. This is not one of those times. This is the kind of taco (quesadilla?) you get when you just want pure, unadulterated excess. Total meatgasm.
       The official outpost is in Rosarito, where apparently an
      even better version is served. I'll report back once I try.

      Regular corn tortilla tacos are also on offer here, and they usually have a deal for 3 corn tortillas with a drink. However the perrones reigns king here and should be the only reason you came. <br />

      <em><------- The namesake perrones taco.</em>
      <br> <br>
      I recommend coming around noon, as that is when they are grilling a fresh batch of meat to meet
      the lunch crowd demand. One thing I've noticed is that chicken is not a taco meat offering here in Mexico. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment and hope the milquetoasts may find their chicken tacos at their local Baja Fresh and leave the real taco eating to us. Hopefully one day the chicken taco will die, but as long as McNuggets are a popular commidity we will have to live with that evil. Are you really living when picking dry chicken meat over luscious suadero or adobada? <br> <br> The habanero salsa here is to die for, if you can handle the heat. I personally like to unfold the perrones, add salsa roja and verde on opposite sides, fold it back up, and and pour on a little habanero salsa as needed in between bites. To douse it completely in their habanero salsa is a bit much and you will overwhelm the perrones with painful heat. However as it is, eat it as you like. Perhaps I'm the pussy here. <br> <br> Ask for
      more salsa if you are ordering togo as they can be skimpy with the goods. If you are extra hungry, go for the super perrones, which is basically the perrones but doubled in size and enough to feed you and you again later that night. Wash it all down with a cup of their caldo de res (basically a beef consomme) and that is a meal worth having with no compromise at any hour of the day.
