      Sushi, of the highest quality, used to be a street food. They were served
      from stands where you would eat while standing, pay, and then be on your
      way. Sushi of the same caliber is now considered a relic, and can only be
      found in Michelin-starred sushi bars, where the cost of admittance can
      range from $100-300+ per person. How did it go from a street food to a
      status symbol food? <br />
      <br />
      Sushi is a guarded art, where the cost of learning involves years of
      hazing, bullying, and general exploitation of labor before you are allowed
      into the “club”. Those who make it in repeat this cycle onto newcomers as
      they want them to suffer as they have. We intend to forgo the ancient
      teaching method and instruct our team in a streamlined, encouraging
      environment. We intend to offer the highest quality sushi available in a
      casual dining/takeout environment.
